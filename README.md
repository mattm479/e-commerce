  ## Installation
  To install this project, clone the repository at https://github.com/mattm479/e-commerce. From there, you will need to rename the `.env.EXAMPLE` file to `.env` and update the parameters with the values for your application. After that, you will need to run `npm i` to install the packages. Once the packages have been installed, you will need to run `psql -U <YOUR_USERNAME> -f db/schema.sql`. You will then be prompted to enter your password and once completed the database will be created. The next step is to seed the database - to do so, you will run `npm run seed` and you should get output showing the data has been seeded.
